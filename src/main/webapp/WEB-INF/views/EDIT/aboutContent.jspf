	 <h3>About Cloud Control</h3>
	 <p>CloudControl is a web-based dashboard which provides administrative controls to deploy and manage Docker images in the cloud.  In particular, the web interface makes it easy for users unfamiliar with Docker to utilize Docker docker-based technologies. Users of CloudControl do not need to possess in-depth knowledge of Docker commands.</p>

     <p>What sets CloudControl apart from other Docker/Cloud technologies is user management layer with users, roles, and permissions.  The CloudControl administrator can customize the user environment to grant access to predetermined images and Docker engines, and configure/limit the Docker commands the user is allowed to perform.</p>
